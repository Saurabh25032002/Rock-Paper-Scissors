Rock-Paper-Scissors
Developing a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent way to practice web development skills. The project involves creating a user interface with HTML, styling it with CSS for an engaging look, and using JavaScript to implement the game logic. Players select rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly generates its choice. JavaScript then compares the selections, determines the winner, and updates the interface to display the result. This project reinforces key concepts such as event handling, conditional logic, and dynamic content manipulation, providing a fun and interactive learning experience
